## 1 INTRODUCTION

### 1.1 Important information and who we are
Welcome to ReadyMovers’s Privacy and Data Protection Policy (“Privacy Policy”).
At ReadyMovers (“we”, “us”, or “our”) we are committed to protecting and respecting
your privacy and Personal Data in compliance with the United Kingdom General Data
Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), the Data Protection Act 2018 and all other mandatory laws
and regulations of the United Kingdom.

This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, process and keep your data safe. The Privacy
Policy will tell you about your privacy rights, how the law protects you, and inform our
employees and staff members of all their obligations and protocols when processing data.

**The individuals from which we may gather and use data can include:**
- __Customers__
- __Business contacts__
- __Third parties connected to your customers__
- __and any other people that the organisation has a relationship with or may need to contact.__

This Privacy Policy applies to all our employees and staff members and all Personal Data
processed at any time by us.


### 1.2 Your Data Controller
ReadyMovers is your Data Controller and responsible for your Personal Data. We are not
obliged by the GDPR to appoint a data protection officer and have not voluntarily
appointed one at this time. Therefore, any inquiries about your data should either be sent
to us by email to [ask@readymovers.com](mailto:ask@readymovers.com) or by post to 124 City Road, London, EC1V 2NX,
United Kingdom.

You have the right to make a complaint at any time to the Information Commissioner’s
Office (ICO), the UK supervisory authority for data protection issues (www.ico.org.uk). We
would, however, appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns before you approach
the ICO so please contact us in the first instance.

### 1.3 Processing data on behalf of a Controller and processors’ responsibility to you
In discharging our responsibilities as a Data Controller we have employees who will deal
with your data on our behalf (known as “Processors”). The responsibilities below may be
assigned to an individual or may be taken to apply to the organisation as a whole. 

__The Data Controller and our Processors have the following responsibilities:__

- Ensure that all processing of Personal Data is governed by one of the legal bases laid out in the GDPR 
(see 2.2 below for more    information);
- Ensure that Processors authorised to process Personal Data have committed
themselves to confidentiality or are under an appropriate statutory obligation of
confidentiality;
- Implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of
security appropriate to the risk associated with the processing of Personal Data;
- Obtain the prior specific or general authorisation of the Controller before engaging
another Processor;
- Assist the Controller in the fulfilment of the Controller's obligation to respond to
requests for exercising the data subject's rights;
- Make available to the Controller all information necessary to demonstrate
compliance with the obligations laid down in the GDPR and allow for and contribute
to audits, including inspections, conducted by the Controller or another auditor
mandated by the Controller;
- Maintain a record of all categories of processing activities carried out on behalf of a
Controller;
- Cooperate, on request, with the supervisory authority in the performance of its
tasks;
- Ensure that any person acting under the authority of the Processor who has access
to Personal Data does not process Personal Data except on instructions from the
Controller; 
- and Notify the Controller without undue delay after becoming aware of a Personal Data Breach.



## 2 LEGAL BASIS FOR DATA COLLECTION

### 2.1 Types of data / Privacy policy scope
“Personal Data” means any information about an individual from which that person can
be identified. It does not include data where the identity has been removed (anonymous
data).

We may collect, use, store and transfer different kinds of Personal Data about you which
we have grouped together below. Not all of the following types of data will necessarily be
collected from you but this is the full scope of data that we collect and when we collect it
from you:

- __Profile/Identity Data:__ This is data relating to your first name, last name, gender, date of birth.
- __Contact Data:__ This is data relating to your phone number, addresses, email addresses, phone numbers.
- __Marketing and Communications Data:__ This is your preferences in receiving
marketing information and other information from us.


_We do not collect any Special Categories of Personal Data about you (this includes details
about your race or ethnicity, religious or philosophical beliefs, sex life, sexual orientation,
political opinions, trade union membership, information about your health, and genetic
and biometric data). Nor do we collect any information about criminal convictions and
offences._


### 2.2 The Legal Basis for Collecting That Data

There are a number of justifiable reasons under the GDPR that allow collection and
processing of Personal Data. 

The main avenues we rely on are:

- __“Consent”:__ Certain situations allow us to collect your Personal Data, such as when
you tick a box that confirms you are happy to receive email newsletters from us, or
‘opt in’ to a service.
- __“Contractual Obligations”:__ We may require certain information from you in order
to fulfil our contractual obligations and provide you with the promised service.
- __“Legal Compliance”:__ We’re required by law to collect and process certain types of
data, such as fraudulent activity or other illegal actions.
- __“Legitimate Interest”:__ We might need to collect certain information from you to be
able to meet our legitimate interests - this covers aspects that can be reasonably
expected as part of running our business, that will not have a material impact on
your rights, freedom or interests. Examples could be your address, so that we know
where to deliver something to, or your name, so that we have a record of who to
contact moving forwards.



## 3 HOW WE USE YOUR PERSONAL DATA

### 3.1 Our data uses
We will only use your Personal Data when the law allows us to.


### 3.2 Marketing and content updates
You will receive marketing and new content communications from us unless you
specifically request that you would not like to receive these communications. From time to
time we may make suggestions and recommendations to you about goods or services that
may be of interest to you.


### 3.3 Change of purpose
We will only use your Personal Data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we
reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is
compatible with the original purpose. If you wish to get an explanation as to how the
processing for the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please contact us.
If we need to use your Personal Data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we
will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.

_Please note that we may process your Personal Data without your knowledge or consent,
in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law._



## 4 YOUR RIGHTS AND HOW YOU ARE PROTECTED BY US

### 4.1 Your legal rights
Under certain circumstances, you have the following rights under data protection laws in
relation to your personal data:

#### Right to be informed. 
You have a right to be informed about our purposes for
processing your personal data, how long we store it for, and who it will be shared
with. We have provided this information to you in this policy.

#### Right of access. 
This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold
about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it (also known as a "data
subject access request"). _See section 4.4 below for more details on how you can
make a data subject access request._

#### Right to rectification. 
You have a right to request correction of the personal data
that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data
we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new
data you provide to us.

#### Right to erasure. 
You have the right to ask us to delete or remove personal data
where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it, where you have
successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may
have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your
personal data to comply with local law. 

Note, however, that we may not always be
able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be
notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.

#### Right to object. 
You can object to the processing of personal data we hold about
you. This effectively allows you to stop or prevent us from processing your personal
data. 

Note that this is not an absolute right and it only applies in certain
circumstances, for example:

- (i) Where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes.
- (ii) Where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and
there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to
object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your
fundamental rights and freedoms.
- (iii) In some cases, we may continue processing your data if we can demonstrate
that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information
which override your rights and freedoms.

#### Right to restrict processing. 
You have the right to request the restriction or
suppression of their personal data. 

Note that this is not an absolute right and it only
applies in certain circumstances:

- (i) If you want us to establish the data's accuracy.
- (ii) Where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it.
- (iii) Where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you
need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.
- (iv) You have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we
have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.

#### Right to data portability. 
You have the right to request the transfer of your
personal data to you or to a third party. If you make such a request, we will provide
to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured,
commonly used, machine-readable format. 

Note that this right only applies to
automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where
we used the information to perform a contract with you.
If you wish to make a request under any of these rights, please contact us at
[ask@readymovers.com](mailto:ask@readymovers.com).


### 4.2 How ReadyMovers protects customers' Personal Data
We are concerned with keeping your data secure and protecting it from inappropriate
disclosure. We implement a variety of security measures to ensure the security of your
Personal Data on our systems, including We implement certain security measures to
ensure the security of your data on our systems, by adopting a secure protocol and data
encryption where necessary. 

Any Personal Data collected by us is only accessible by a
limited number of employees who have special access rights to such systems and are
bound by obligations of confidentiality. If and when we use subcontractors to store your
data, we will not relinquish control of your Personal Data or expose it to security risks that
would not have arisen had the data remained in our possession. 

However, unfortunately
no transmission of data over the internet is guaranteed to be completely secure. It may be
possible for third parties not under the control of ReadyMovers to intercept or access
transmissions or private communications unlawfully. While we strive to protect your
Personal Data, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any Personal Data you
transmit to us. Any such transmission is done at your own risk. If you believe that your
interaction with us is no longer secure, please contact us. [@ask@readymovers.com](mailto:@ask@readymovers.com)


### 4.3 Opting out of marketing promotions
You can ask us to stop sending you marketing messages at any time by contacting us at
any time.
Where you opt out of receiving these marketing messages, we will continue to retain other
Personal Data provided to us as a result of interactions with us not related to your
marketing preferences.


### 4.4 How to request your data and the process for obtaining it
You will not have to pay a fee to access your Personal Data (or to exercise any of the other
rights). However, if your request is clearly unfounded, we could refuse to comply with your
request.
We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity
and ensure you have the right to access your Personal Data (or to exercise any of your
other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that Personal Data is not disclosed to
any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further
information in relation to your request to speed up our response.



## 5 YOUR DATA AND THIRD PARTIES

### 5.1 Sharing your data with third parties
We may share non-Personal Data with third parties. We may share your Personal Data
with subcontractors or affiliates, subject to confidentiality obligations to use it only for the
purposes for which we disclose it to them and pursuant to our instructions.

We may also share Personal Data with interested parties in the event that ReadyMovers
anticipates a change in control or the acquisition of all or part of our business or assets or
with interested parties in connection with the licensing of our technology.
If ReadyMovers is sold or makes a sale or transfer, we may, in our sole discretion,
transfer, sell or assign your Personal Data to a third party as part of or in connection with
that transaction. Upon such transfer, the Privacy Policy of the acquiring entity may govern
the further use of your Personal Data. 

In all other situations your data will still remain
protected in accordance with this Privacy Policy (as amended from time to time).
We may share your Personal Data at any time if required for legal reasons or in order to
enforce our terms or this Privacy Policy.



## 6 HOW LONG WE RETAIN YOUR DATA
We will only retain your Personal Data for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfil the purposes
we collected it for. We may retain your Personal Data for a longer period than usual in the event
of a complaint or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation in respect to our
relationship with you.



## 7 INTERNATIONAL TRANSFER OF DATA
Your information may be stored and processed in the US or other countries or jurisdictions
outside the US where ReadyMovers has facilities. By using ReadyMovers, you are permitting
and consenting to the transfer of information, including Personal Data, outside of the US.



## 8 NOTIFICATION OF CHANGES AND ACCEPTANCE OF POLICY
We keep our Privacy Policy under review and will place any updates here. This version is dated __8 July 2024__.
By using ReadyMovers, you consent to the collection and use of data by us as set out in this
Privacy Policy. Continued access or use of ReadyMovers will constitute your express acceptance
of any modifications to this Privacy Policy.



## 9 INTERPRETATION
All uses of the word "including" mean "including but not limited to" and the enumerated
examples are not intended to in any way limit the term which they serve to illustrate. Any email
addresses set out in this policy may be used solely for the purpose for which they are stated to
be provided, and any unrelated correspondence will be ignored. Unless otherwise required by
law, we reserve the right to not respond to emails, even if they relate to a legitimate subject
matter for which we have provided an email address. You are more likely to get a reply if your
request or question is polite, reasonable and there is no relatively obvious other way to deal with
or answer your concern or question (e.g. FAQs, other areas of our website, etc.).

Our staff are not authorised to contract on behalf of ReadyMovers, waive rights or make
representations (whether contractual or otherwise). If anything contained in an email from a Maz
Moves Ltd address contradicts anything in this policy, our terms or any official public
announcement on our website, or is inconsistent with or amounts to a waiver of any Maz Moves
Ltd rights, the email content will be read down to grant precedence to the latter. The only
exception to this is genuine correspondence expressed to be from the ReadyMovers legal
department.
